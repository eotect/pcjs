COMPAQ DeskPro 386 Machines with IBM EGA
----------------------------------------

All our EGA configurations use the `Rev F` [COMPAQ DeskPro 386 ROM](/devices/pcx86/rom/compaq/deskpro386/), dated
September 4, 1986.  It is currently the oldest available DeskPro 386 ROM.  The VGA did not exist until 1987, so it
makes sense to use EGA-based machines with a contemporary ROM.
