COMPAQ DeskPro 386 ROMs
-----------------------

Originally, the oldest COMPAQ DeskPro 386 ROM I had was a `Rev J.4` ROM from a "Version 2" motherboard designed
in 1987, released in 1988, and purchased on eBay in October 2014.

[<img src="Compaq_DeskPro_386-16_System_Board_V2-640.jpg" alt="Compaq DeskPro 386 System Board Version 2"/>](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/archive.pcjs.org/devices/pcx86/rom/compaq/deskpro386/Compaq_DeskPro_386-16_System_Board_V2.jpg)

And thanks to folks on the [Vintage Computer](http://www.vintage-computer.com/) forums, I was later able to add
the `Rev N.1` ROM from 1989 to this collection.  And when I obtained a DeskPro 386/25 from eBay in March 2015, I was
able to add the `Rev K.2` ROM.

More recently (January 2018), I discovered that I still had a copy of the 1986 `Rev F` ROM, which I had made on
April 22, 1987, using one of the early DeskPro 386 machines that Microsoft had purchased for the OS/2 development team.
The only downside of my `Rev F` ROM image is that it was dumped using the DOS `DEBUG` utility, since I didn't have
ROM reader hardware in those days.  Fortunately, since I wasn't sure how large the ROM actually was, I had dumped the
entire 64Kb from F000:0000 through F000:FFFF.  As it turns out, that entire address range is actually write-protected
RAM (since RAM provided faster 32-bit access), where the first 32Kb contained a modified copy of the second.  For example,
the first 32Kb contains some data structures that are updated by COMPAQ utilities such as `CEMM` to record "Built-in Memory"
allocations.

Sure enough, attempting to use the [first 32Kb](1986-09-04/1986-09-04-LO.json) as a DeskPro 386 ROM generated a
"ROM Error", no doubt due to a checksum mismatch.  However, the [second 32Kb](1986-09-04/1986-09-04-HI.json) appeared
to work fine.  I can't guarantee that its contents are identical to the original `Rev F` ROM, since it was not a direct
copy of the physical ROM, but it's all we've got.  All our
[EGA-based COMPAQ machine configurations](/devices/pcx86/machine/compaq/deskpro386/ega/) have been updated to use that ROM.

This collection of COMPAQ DeskPro 386 ROMs still has several holes, but I'm very happy to have finally found one of the
earliest (if not *the* earliest) ROMs commercially available for this line of COMPAQ computers.

### System ROM Revisions

	Rev  Even ROM #  Odd ROM #   Size  Date
	---  ----------  ----------  ----  ----
	E    108285-001  108284-001
	F    108328-001  108327-001  32Kb  1986-09-04
	G    108328-002  108327-002
	H.8  113270-008  113269-008
	J.4  109592-001  109591-001  32Kb  1988-01-28 (from a 386/16 motherboard)
	K.2  109592-003  109591-003  32Kb  1988-05-10 (from a 386/25 motherboard)
	M.1  109592-004  109591-004
	N.1  109592-005  109591-005  32Kb  1989-04-14	

[1988-01-28.json](1988-01-28/1988-01-28.json) was created with the following [FileDump](/modules/filedump/) command:

	cd 1988-01-28
	filedump --file=109592-001.hex --merge=109591-001.hex --output=1988-01-28.json

For a more human-readable dump, use the `--comments` option:

	filedump --file=109592-001.hex --merge=109591-001.hex --output=1988-01-28.dump --comments

And for those who want a binary file, the FileDump API can be used to recreate binary data from JSON data:

	http://localhost:8088/api/v1/dump?file=http://localhost:8088/devices/pcx86/rom/compaq/deskpro386/1988-01-28/1988-01-28.json&format=rom

Similarly, [1989-04-14.json](1989-04-14/1989-04-14.json) was generated by first creating **1989-04-14.rom**
from the two 16Kb BIN files provided by [Al Kossow](http://www.vintage-computer.com/vcforum/member.php?2256-Al-Kossow):

	cd 1989-04-14
	filedump --file=archive/109592-005.U11.bin --merge=archive/109591-005.U13.bin --output=archive/1989-04-14.rom --format=rom
	filedump --file=archive/1989-04-14.rom --output=1989-04-14.json

Dumping the ROMs
----------------

The *.hex* files for the 1988-01-28 DeskPro ROM were produced by running
[eeprom_read](http://github.com/phooky/PROM/blob/master/tools/eeprom_read/eeprom_read.pde)
on a [chipKIT Uno32](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,892,893&Prod=CHIPKIT-UNO32)
Arduino-compatible prototyping board, and capturing the serial port output on my MacBook Pro -- as outlined in
"[Stick a Straw in Its Brain and Suck: How to Read a ROM](http://www.nycresistor.com/2012/07/07/stick-a-straw-in-its-brain-and-suck-how-to-read-a-rom/)"
by [NYC Resistor](http://www.nycresistor.com/) contributor [phooky](http://www.nycresistor.com/author/phooky/).

The DeskPro 386 ROMs were P27128A-2 chips, so I wired my Uno32 based on this
[27128A](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/archive.pcjs.org/pubs/pc/datasheets/27128A.pdf) datasheet -- the closest match I could find online.

![<img src="Compaq_DeskPro_386-16_System_ROM_V2_Breadboard-640.jpg" alt="Compaq DeskPro 386 System ROM Version 2"/>](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/archive.pcjs.org/devices/pcx86/rom/compaq/deskpro386/Compaq_DeskPro_386-16_System_ROM_V2_Breadboard.jpg)

On my first dump attempt, every ROM address returned 0xFF.  After looking at the 27128A datasheet more closely,
I noticed the DEVICE OPERATION table indicated that, for a READ operation, /CE and /OE pins should be connected to
INPUT LOW VOLTAGE, while the /PGM should be connected to INPUT HIGH VOLTAGE.  So I wired pin 27 (/PGM) to +5V instead
of GND, and the dump worked perfectly.  The NYC Resistor article implied that every *active low* pin should be
connected to GND, but apparently there are exceptions to that general rule.

Recreating ROM Source Code
--------------------------

In the current directory, an original ROM can be regenerated from the JSON-encoded file:

	cd 1988-01-28
	node ../../../../../../modules/filedump/bin/filedump --file=1988-01-28.json --output=1988-01-28.rom --format=rom

The ROM can then be fed into NDISASM, the disassembler included with NASM:

	ndisasm -o0x8000 -se105h -se05ah -se6ffh -sf025h -sf8aah 1988-01-28.rom > 1988-01-28.asm

The `-o0x8000` argument is required to "org" the file at the proper starting address, but the `-s` arguments
are optional; they simply establish a few sync points within the ROM image that save a little cleanup effort, by
preventing disassembly in the middle of instructions.

Next, the PCjs [TextOut](/modules/textout/) command, with the *--nasm* option, prepares the code for reassembly:

	node ../../../../../../modules/textout/bin/textout --file=1988-01-28.asm --nasm > temp.asm
	mv temp.asm 1988-01-28.asm

The result, [1988-01-28.asm](1988-01-28/1988-01-28.asm), after a small amount of manual cleanup, can now be
successfully reassembled:

	nasm -f bin 1988-01-28.asm -l 1988-01-28.lst -o 1988-01-28.rom

However, it does NOT produce a binary identical to the original ROM, in part because of instruction ambiguities (ie,
instructions that can be assembled multiple ways).  It's possible the reassembled ROM may still work, but more research
is required.

One interesting section of the COMPAQ DeskPro ROM is this string at offset 0xE002:
 
	db	'AUTHORS CAB93GLB93RWS93DJC93NPB(C)Copyright COMPAQ Computer Corporation 1982,83,84,85,86'

which appears to list the initials of 5 authors: **CAB**, **GLB**, **RWS**, **DJC**, and **NPB**.  The meaning of the
"93" sequences is unknown; they may have simply been a form of obfuscation.
